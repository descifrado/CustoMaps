A tool to analyse alternative paths between two location on GOOGLE MAPS to get the customized result which will be based on user requirements


## Why We Built This
Keeping in mind the safety and security of women(or kids) on roads while travelling through unknown terrains, we are here with our version of google maps which is customized to give not only the most time saving route but also giving the best route based in following

## 1. Safety
One would prefer a path with a police station in it rather than the one with bars and liquor-shops..
Google Maps will show only the path taking least time but using our custom maps service one will also get the safest path based upon the statistics of crime and places occuring on the route

## 2. Entertainment
On a trip with friends one wants to enjoy the way so one wants a route with restaurants, cafes, malls etc.
Customised results of our app will give the most entertaining route for the gang eventhough it will take more time but will surely create unforgettable memories

## 3. Accident Count
Going on drive with family, no one wants to face accidents...
Certain crossings and spots are there which are very much prone to accidents but Google Maps don't care about them
Using our tool one can make sure that even though a little more time will be needed but one can reach the destination safely

## Working
We have used Google Maps APIs such as Directions API for getting all the routes between two locations.
Then we have used Places API to get the near by places on each route.
We have calculated score of each route based on the static points alloted to each type of place.
